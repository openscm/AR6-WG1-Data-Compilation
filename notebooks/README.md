# Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks that replicate several key figures
of the IPCC AR6 WG1 report to facilitate reproducibility of the assessment
and re-use in subsequent research and analysis.
Each notebook is named after the figure it reproduces.
The last part of the notebook name shows the package which is used 
for data-handling (and potentially plotting) in the notebook 
e.g. if the notebook's name ends in `-scmdata` then the 
[scmdata](https://scmdata.readthedocs.io) package is used for 
data-handling, if the notebook's name ends in `-pyam` then the 
[pyam](https://pyam-iamc.readthedocs.io) package is used for
data-handling.
